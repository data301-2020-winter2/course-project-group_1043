## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We thought it would be interesting to observe what factors, besides the merits of the project itself, would optimize success when launching a Kickstarter.  The goal is to look for qualities of successful projects, such as goal amount, category, deadline, etc. to build a profile of reasonable goals, and what aspects one should consider when creating a Kickstarter.  We hope to manipulate our data into charts such that the Kickstarters become clearly graphically optimal for given parameters.  We would also like to try weighting successfulness with the amount contributed, in order to establish some sort of expected value, and possibly maximize this instead of a binary success (i.e. maximize "profit" for a Kickstarter project).  We speculate that there will be a clear link between viability of project goals and their successfulness, suggesting Kickstarter users should be wary of having too lofty of expectations.  In addition, we would also like to investigate what categories of projects are more viable.  This data would fit very nicely on a graphical dashboard, and likely show some interesting conclusions when juxtaposing different categories against each other and showing optimal peaks of "profit".

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Kickstarter project dataset was collected by Mickaël Mouillé, a user on a website called Kaggle.  Professionaly, he is the CTO at CTO at Biborg, although the data was used for a twitter bot and some of the other ideas of Mouillé's.  The data tracks the funds raised for various Kickstarter.com crowd-funded projects, including the number of backers, goal amount, amount raised, countries, successfulness, and dates of launch/completion.  The data was collected between 2009 and 2016 and serves mostly for interest/learning: as crowdfunding data (at least mostly not ethically) doesn't really have a financial value besides aiding the launch other crowdfunding platforms (i.e. trying to maximize successfulness of funding or given some fundamental change to platform structure).  It's not stated how the data was collected, but with 300k+ rows, it's safe to assme that it was done by some sort of bot that crawled Kickstarter.com during these years.
